### Project Title
Analysing Bikeshare data using Python

### Description
Analyse Bikeshare data of 3 cities- Washinton, New York City and Chicago- using Python.  
Get insights into busiest day of week/time of day, popular stations and routes, durations of trips and user statistics.  
Get raw data, if required. Raw data is staged 5 rows at a time.

### How to use
Put all 3 csv files and python file in the same folder and execute python file on terminal.  
Interact with your terminal to filter data by month or day of week or both.  

### Files used
City-wise bikeshare data files were used as part of this project. They are available at ... (unable to access the links where csv files were originally downloaded from)

### Credits
This project was done as part of Udacity course on Programming for Data Science (Python).
Bikeshare data was sourced from motivateco.com
I used Jupyter notebook for testing small snippets of code while Atom.io is my main code editor
